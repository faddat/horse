## Note!


Horse will be a live-fire devnet.   It will have "real" bridgeable coins and a full validator set, but it is essential to note before proceeding that this thing absolutely may explode for various reasons.

Horse comes with zero warranty of any kind, for any reason, and even if this chain shoots your dog, well, that's on you for using a dangerous, untested blockchain.
