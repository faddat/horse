# ADR 001: Mantrachain ADR Creation

## Context

There is a need for a scalable structure of Mantrachain ADR documentation. Current decisions made are often recorded at multiple different places (notion, slack, other messaging apps) or not recorded at all. Starting from commit 99fd49f11413d36993ef31fdca7b3455c3de2f0d, the adr folder is created to record any architectural decisions the Mantrachain team makes.

## Decision

All future architectural decisions are to be recorded in the `/adr` folder. The structure references the cosmos-sdk [adr folder](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/docs/architecture)

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

### Positive

* Improved documentation of all architectural decisions, readily accessible to all stakeholders in a central location.
